# ESE532fall2019_emulation
This repo is to show you how to use simulation and emulation to debug your code, which will be implemented by SDSoC.

# Description
SDSoC is an excellent tool for SoC design. It exclude a lot of gluing logic design between hardware and software. The designers can focus on some high level architection design. However, it abstracts away some essential details, which is bad for debugging. Nevertheless, it offers you some methods, by which you can do some low level debuging. Emulation is one of the useful tools, which we will focus on in the following sections.


# Buffer Lock Example
Include all the source code under ./examples/BufferLock/ into SDSoC. Move the data
